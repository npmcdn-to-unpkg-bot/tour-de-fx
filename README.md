# Tour de Frameworks

This is an example repository that takes you on a tour of each javascript framework.

* Angular 1.5 (Component Style)
* React
* Angular 2
* Aurelia
* Vue
* Virtual
* Yo-Yo

Each folder is a framework slide show presentation and the example code to build
a simple todo app, the app is as important as each implementation.

This is a work in progress, contributions are welcome.
